# CLTV clustering of e-commerce data

Customer lifetime value is an important problem in e-commerce for multiple reasons. In this repository we explore different methods to tackle that problem and present our insights. For a broad understanding of CLTV, refer to the [website](https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/cltv/introduction).

The final code can be found at ```cltv_clustering.ipynb```. For detailed expalnation of the problem and solution approach refer to ```Report.pdf```. 

```web_scraping_and_api_data.ipynb``` and ```preprocessing_data.ipynb``` are the code files which need to be run in that order. 

In ```web_scraping_and_api_data.ipynb```, the data extraction using the API takes about 45 mins to extract all the data according to the zipcodes.  

Rest all are data files.
